# Darkness has Teeth

**Darkness has Teeth** introduces new thrill to mining in complete darkness. Inspired by the oppressive, audio-driven threat mechanics of the Lycanites Minecraft mod, this mod teaches you to be careful rather than treating mining as a background activity.

Subtle warnings escalate into unmistakable signs that something is wrong - ambient sounds, mounting pressure, and finally the realization that the darkness itself is no longer passive.

Mine carelessly, and the world will remind you why light exists.
